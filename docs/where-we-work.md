# Where we work

## Toronto HQ
We have an office in the heart of Toronto's Chinatown. There's great food nearby and we're steps from Kensington Market, Queen West, and other desirable locations like that. It's really easy to get to by public transportation and bike, and if you have to drive, there's an affordable lot across the street.

You're welcome to use the office whenever you like, and we will require you to come in on certain occasions when the need arises to do certain group activities that are best conducted in-person.

There is free coffee and tea in the office, plus hot and cold filtered water. When there's a group of us in, we tend to provide lunch, and if you stay until the end of the day, there's a good chance we'll take you for a drink too.

## Your place (in Canada)
Remote work is obviously not a fad and we're fine for you to work from home. We provide a $75/month stipend to compensate you for use of your home internet and personal mobile phone, whether you work from home or not.

If you are working from home, we ask that you try to work from a private room with a closed door. Some of your calls may be confidential, and you need to keep them that way, no matter where you are.

## Parks, coffee shops, and other public places
By all means, get out of the house! Just make sure not to take any sensitive calls in public places or work on sensitive or confidential documents in places where someone could look over your shoulder.

__*NB: We STRONGLY advise that you connect to the internet using a VPN when working from a public place. Public wifi is a notorious hangout spots for password thieves.*__

## Elsewhere in the world
As an organization that employs many immigrants, it's understandable that you may want to spend an extended period of time in another country where you have family and friends. This is acceptable for a limited period, as long as your manager approves and you come up with a reasonable system for dealing with time differences.
