# Where we work

## Toronto HQ
We have an office in the heart of downtown Toronto, very close to Union Station and the Rogers Centre. It's really easy to get to by public transportation and bike, and if you have to drive, there's a lot in the building for $20/day.

Our office is housed inside OneEleven, a co-working space for tech scale ups that have proven their viability and are growing fast. The space is buzzing with smart and interesting people. We are the only charity there. Like many tech-ish offices, ours has a ping pong table, free coffee and tea that's actually quite good, and even a nap room with some comfy hammocks if you need it. When there's a big group of us in, we tend to provide lunch, and if you stay until the end of the day, there's a decent chance we'll take you for a drink too!

You're welcome to use the office whenever you like, and we will require you to come in at least two days per week if you live within a reasonable commuting distance.

## Ottawa and Montréal Hubs
If you live in Ottawa or Montréal, or if you're passing through for work, you can enjoy co-working spaces we rent there.

## Your place (in Canada)
Remote work is obviously not a fad and we're fine for you to work from home. We provide a $75/month stipend to compensate you for use of your home internet and personal mobile phone, whether you work from home or not.

If you are working from home, we ask that you try to work from a private room with a closed door. Some of your calls may be confidential, and you need to keep them that way, no matter where you are.

## Parks, coffee shops, and other public places
By all means, get out of the house! Just make sure not to take any sensitive calls in public places or work on sensitive or confidential documents in places where someone could look over your shoulder. You should have a conversation with your manager about the types of activities that are conducive to public workspaces vs. those that aren’t.

__*NB: We STRONGLY advise that you connect to the internet using a VPN when working from a public place. Public wifi is a notorious hangout spots for password thieves.*__

## Elsewhere in the world
As an organization that employs many immigrants, it's understandable that you may want to spend an extended period of time in another country where you have family and friends. This is acceptable for a limited period, as long as your manager approves and you come up with a reasonable system for dealing with time differences.
