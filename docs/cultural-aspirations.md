# Cultural aspirations

Just as in broader society, an organization's culture can't be dictated from above. Cultures form organically.

The best we can do, therefore, is to declare what we aspire to be.

These aspirations were created by our senior leadership group with significant input from a volunteer committee of more junior staff. They are not a one-size-fits-all model, and some aspects will resonate more than others for different people and teams. Nonetheless, we hope that youâ€™ll strive to get us closer to these ideals, and speak up when you see us getting away from them.

We aspire to have a culture that is:

1. __Grounded in service__. We serve newcomers to serve Canada. The whole country benefits from newcomers' contributions, which means the whole country benefits from our work to make newcomers feel at home here. We take great pride in doing this work well.

2. __Deliberate__. We don't run around like chickens with their heads cut off, reacting frantically to whatever comes at us. We take our time to think things through, be strategic, and make deliberate choices about how we want to spend our limited energy.

3. __Determined__. Not many people can say that their work can change the course of a whole country. We can. We try to make the most of this privilege by pushing each other to always do better and supporting each other as we do. We encourage each other to adopt a 10x mentality -- to think maximally. Big ideas belong here.

4. __Human__. We're all just people. We're professional, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. We mostly dress informally. No matter our rank, we're direct, honest, and straightforward with each other. We don't beat around the bush or use evasive or performative language. We've got no time for passive (or active) aggression. Issues inevitably come up. We deal with them respectfully and professionally.

5. __Always evolving__. Every new ICC member brings in a new richness to our work culture. We welcome and encourage new ideas. We make mistakes. We try to learn from them, adjust, and move forward.
