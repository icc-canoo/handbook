# Cultural aspirations

Just as in broader society, organizational culture can't be dictated from above. Cultures form organically and they have a way of reproducing themselves even when teams and people change.

The best we can do, therefore, is to declare what we aspire to be. We hope you'll do your part to get us closer to these ideals, and speak up when you see us getting away from them.

We aspire to have a culture that is:

1. __Grounded in service__. We serve the public -- not just newcomers, but the entire country that benefits from newcomers' contributions. We take great pride in doing so well.

2. __Deliberate__. We don't run around like chickens with their heads cut off, reacting frantically to whatever comes at us. We take our time to think things through, be strategic, and make deliberate choices about how we want to spend our energy.

3. __Hungry__. Not many people can say that their work can change the course of a country. We can. We try to make the most of this privilege by pushing each other to always do better and supporting each other as we do. We encourage each other to adopt a 10x mentality -- to think maximally.

4. __Human__. We're all just people. We're professional, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. No matter our rank, we're direct, honest, and straightforward with each other. We don't beat around the bush or use evasive or performative language. We've got no time for passive aggression. Issues inevitably come up. We deal with them respectfully and professionally. We mostly dress informally.

5. __Always learning__. We make mistakes. We try things that don't work. Then we come up with new ideas.
