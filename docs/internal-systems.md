## 1Password
The home of __*ALL*__ (yes, all) of your logins and passwords. The security of our systems is paramount. Shared logins and other bush league practices put our organization and its beneficiaries at risk. Don't be that person. Use 1Password 100% of the time.

## WagePoint
This is where you access pay stubs, update payment details, find your T4, find your employment agreement(s) and request vacation and log sick/personal days. Sometimes, youâ€™ll be asked to electronically sign your agreement to policies or other documents through this system too.

## Microsoft Viva Goals (formerly Ally.io)
This is where your OKRs are tracked and updated. The easiest way to use this is via the MS Teams integration, but you can also login with your browser. You can also set up integrations with Salesforce, a database, or even a spreadsheet,  so your OKRs update automatically.

## Salesforce + Campaign Monitor

Make sure to install the Outlook integration for Salesforce so you can log incoming communications properly.
