## Building Citizenship
In partnership with Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (i.e. the federal government), we host about 60 enhanced citizenship ceremonies per year. What are the enhancements?

1. 100% of our ceremonies begin with a welcome from an Indigenous representative. Standard ceremonies don't include this.
2. Our ceremonies feature special guest speakers. Past speakers have included Chris Hadfield, Prime Minister Trudeau, the Rt. Hon. Adrienne Clarkson, David Suzuki, and other highly-respected Canadians.
3. All our ceremonies have an artistic component, including a local anthem singer and sometimes a second performance.
4. Our in-person ceremonies feature our signature roundtables, where new citizens and their families join prominent community members to speak openly about citizenship and what it means.

## Canoo
The Canoo Access Pass gives newcomers VIP access to the very best of Canada -- *for free*. Members (and up to 4 accompanying kids) can visit over 1,400 museums, parks, historical sites, science centres, and other attractions in every province and territory. Members also get exclusive discounts with leading brands like Air Canada, VIA Rail, Aldo, Canadian Tire, LiveNation, Cirque du Soleil, and many many more!

The purpose of Canoo is to help newcomers fall in love with Canada, and it works. 86% of members report an enhanced sense of belonging in Canada after 1 year. 92% continue visiting the places they discovered through Canoo after their membership ends.

As a newcomer-facing service, Canoo has its own brand identity. Checkout [canoo.ca](https//:canoo.ca) to get a sense of it.

## Ideas & Insights (aka The Strategy Hub)
I&I is Canada's leading centre of expertise about citizenship and the contemporary immigration experience. This (small but mighty) team conducts original research and public opinion polling, trains our staff, helps with program evaluation, and publishes useful statistics and dashboards for anyone to use.

## LaFontaine-Baldwin Lectures
Second in prestige to only the Massey Lectures, the LaFontaine-Baldwin Lectures give a prominent speaker a prominent platform to discuss important issues related to Canadian citizenship. Though this was not always the case in the past, we are now focused on having a clear tie-in for newcomers to every Lecture. The Lecture is traditionally followed by an action-oriented roundtable session the following morning.

## Adrienne Clarkson Prize for Global Citizenship
This prize is awarded annually to a prominent global figure who embodies a steadfast commitment to the ideals of belonging and inclusion. As with the LBL, we are working hard to ensure that future winners have a clear tie-in for newcomers.

## 6 Degrees
6 Degrees was a bold experiment. Dubbed "The global forum for inclusion", it was technically a conference, but better described as a festival of ideas, where artists, political leaders, activists and citizens could discuss pressing issues of belonging and inclusion in an unconventional and really fun way.

The ICC held 6 Degrees events in several Canadian cities, but also in Mexico, The Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland. Some pretty cool people attended and the experience was transformational.

6 Degrees was launched in response to the Syrian refugee crisis of 2015, when the world was reluctant to accept those seeking asylum. The plight of asylum seekers has not disappeared but over the years, 6 Degrees drifted away from this theme and we eventually decided that its time had come and gone. The last 6 Degrees was held in 2020.
