# Pay transparency

We strongly believe in pay transparency. It ensures that people make the same amount to do equal work and keeps unnecessary envy and suspicion out of our team.

## How we index pay

As a rule, the ICC sets pay levels at or above the 75th percentile of Canadian non-profit organizations, as determined by Charity Village in their [annual compensation report](https://charityvillage.com/new-2022-canadian-nonprofit-sector-salary-benefits-report-reveals-pandemic-compensation-trends/). This means that we pay more than at least 3/4 of Canadian non-profits. As our revenue grows, we will try to progressively increase our benchmark rate to 80% or 85%.

## Base pay bands
Each job title has a prescribed pay band, as follows:

Title | Min pay | Max pay
---|---|---
Assistant | $52.5k | $57.75k
Specialist | $57.75k | $63k
Lead | $63k | $73.5k
Manager | $75.5k | $84k
Director | $84k | $105k
Senior Director | $105k | $131k

The pay range for a given job is always listed on the job description for full transparency.

## Extras

### WFH stipend
We pay every employee $75/month for use of their personal mobile phone and home internet connection.

### Bilingualism premium
If you speak and write at a professional level in both English and French, we'll increase your base pay by 10%.

### Other add-ons
We increase pay above normal levels for jobs requiring specific skills technical skills like coding. The add-ons for a given job will be listed in the job description.

For some positions at the ICC, a performance bonus will form part of your overall compensation. This will be listed in the job description. Here's how it works (if you're eligible):

1. Your contract will specify a maximum annual bonus amount, usually expressed as a percentage of your base pay. For example, if your base pay is $80k with a 10% maximum bonus, you can make up to $8k extra after 12 months.
2. Bonus payments are determined objectively, using numbers only. __*Subjectivity plays no part in the process*__. Within six weeks of starting, you and your manager will agree in writing to a *quantitative* framework to govern your bonus. Here is a made-up example using the $8k max bonus we just talked about.

Item | Portion | Max amount
---|:---:|:---:
Big new program launched on time | 25% | $2k
10k participants in program  | 50% | $4k
Avg. 4-star reviews from participants | 25% | $2k
|__100%__|__$8k__


3. 12 months after your start, we review the numbers and pay the amount you earned. Unless the bonus item is binary (i.e. all or nothing), you will be paid proportional to your achievement. A more concrete example makes this easier to understand:

Item | Max amount | Achievement | Payment
---|:---:|:---:|---:
Big program launched on time | $2k | Yes! (100%) | $2k
10k participants in program  | $4k | 5k (50%) | $2k
Avg. 4-star reviews from participants | $2k | 3-stars (75%) | $1.5k
| | |__$5.5k__

Bonus payments are subject to the same withholdings as normal salary.)
