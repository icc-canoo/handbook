# Moonlighting

People have lives outside work and we're glad you do! In some cases, people get paid for work they do beyond the ICC, and we refer to this as "moonlighting."

Most of the time we're fine with that and will do what we can to support you. These tend to be growth opportunities and passion projects that are well worth pursuing.

But there are times when moonlighting can go too far and begin to affect your performance at the ICC. Other times, a moonlighting gig can create conflicts of interest or association that we're not OK with.

Since moonlighting is rarely a black or white proposition, we have a few guidelines to help us determine what is and is not OK. Ultimately, the final decision will be made by your direct manager.

## OK

1. An occasional side job for friends or family, whether voluntary or paid. This can be in an area that uses your professional skills. For example, if your ICC job is to plan citizenship ceremonies and your friend hires you to plan their wedding, that's totally OK. Likewise, if you volunteer to organize a gala for a charity you support, that's OK too.

2. An occasional speaking engagement, whether voluntary or paid. Great! Go for it. Just be sure to mention that you work for us 9-5.

3. A small side business thatâ€™s very different from your normal job, so long as the time commitment is no more than a few hours per week. If there's a scheduling conflict, the ICC gets priority.  

4. Serving on a nonprofit board or as a paid board member of a private company with which the ICC has no relationship or interaction. Again, ICC gets priority if there is any scheduling conflict. In any published biographies, you should mention that you work at the ICC.

## Not OK

1. Holding another job, anywhere, either full-time or part-time.

2. Advertising on LinkedIn or other social media that you work somewhere else or leave any ambiguity as to where you work. It must be clear to the world that your side gig is a small passion project.

3. Actively marketing and promoting your availability for side work. If something interesting and manageable comes your way, that's great. But any advertising or promotion for this side work will ultimately become a conflict of interest with the ICC.

4. Taking off more than a day or two for side work, even unpaid. We won't grant requests to take personal leave so you can go on a speaking tour or build another business.

5. Doing paid consulting work for any other charity, company, or foundation that works on matters involving citizenship, immigration, refugees, settlement, or other matters that are directly or even tangentially related to the work of the ICC. If you're unsure about a specific case, ask Daniel or Salimah.

6. Taking on a side gig that will require your attention during working hours. WFH allows for flexibility to pick up your kids of do important day-time errands so you can get back to work later. We love to provide that kind of flexibility. But you can't abuse that trust to take time away from the ICC during working hours to do paid work.

## Still unsure?

No problem. Come talk to Daniel or Salimah if you have any doubt. We'll always try to say yes to reasonable requests, and if it's a bit too much for us to accept, we'll try to modify your proposal to accommodate our shared interests.
