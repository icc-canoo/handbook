## Paid time off

### Your first day
Your very first day is a fully paid day off that doesn't count against your vacation allowance. Do whatever you want to get ready for the next phase of your career.

### Vacation
Everybody at the ICC receives a minimum three weeks of paid vacation. Some positions offer four weeks.

Your manager must approve all vacation requests, and we ask them to approve requests by default unless there is a good reason why they can't. Still, we reserve the right to black out certain periods of vacation before or during a major project, event or launch when your manager deems it necessary.

Vacation is accrued as you work. We're not super sticklers about holiday accrual but we expect you to be reasonable; For example, you can't take your full vacation a month after you start, but if you're taking a week off and have only earned 4 days by that time in the year, we'll let it slide. It's ultimately up to your manager, who we trust to exercise their discretion appropriately.

__*We strongly encourage employees to use their full vacation allowance*__. If you don't use it, you'll lose it. It cannot be carried forward into the following fiscal year and you will not be paid cash in lieu of vacation.

### Birthdays off
Your birthday may not be a statutory holiday, but it's still important! At the ICC, you can take it as a paid day off to celebrate with family and friends. Note, you must take off the actual day of your birthday. If your birthday falls on a weekend, you can choose to take off the Friday before or the Monday after.

### Holiday closures
The ICC tends to close for a week or so around the New Year period. This time off is fully paid and does not count against your vacation allowance.

### Sick / personal days
We do not limit the number of sick days you can take in a year. We take a common sense approach: If you're sick, please don't work. If you're not sick, we expect you to be at work. Simple enough, right? We ask that you log these days in our pay system but you don't need to give a doctor's note or even provide a reason. Just let your manager know with as much advance warning as you can.

You can use these days for personal reasons too. As was just said, you don't need to provide a reason. Just be reasonable and honest. Abusing the honour system may result in disciplinary measures.

If you're out sick for 3 days, your manager can ask you for a doctor's note. If you're out more than 5 days, you transition to unpaid leave, which may be covered by our benefits plan and/or EI.

If you have a medical condition you know will take you away from work regularly, please work with your manager for accommodations.

### Summer Hours

We take Friday afternoons off between July 1 and August 31 every year. We also tack an extra day onto during summer long weekends, turning three days off into four.

These days are discretionary and are not vacation days. If there is an urgent situation to attend to, we may have to ask you to work during this time and you will receive no lieu time in exchange. Obviously, we try not to do this unless the circumstances are really urgent.

### Bereavement Leave

When you lose a loved one, you can take paid time off to mourn, make arrangements, settle family affairs, and attend funeral or memorial services. Please let your manager know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange for your absence.

You can take ten days of bereavement leave for the death of a spouse or partner, child or child-in-law, parent or parent-in-law, or sibling or sibling-in-law. You can take three days of bereavement leave for the death of a grandparent, niece or nephew, cousin, or close friend. These caps are not to say you must return to work after so many days; you can use any of your available vacation time if you find you need more time off after bereavement leave. And if you know youâ€™ll be away from work for much longer than outlined above, please talk to your manager to discuss that special case.

## Family Leave

If you are the primary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 18-months of leave, as prescribed by federal law. We will top up your EI payment to the amount of your usual salary for 4 weeks. If you leave the ICC within 6 months of your parental leave ending, you will be required to return the top-up amount.

If you are the secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 4 weeks' leave, though this is unpaid.

In both cases, we will provide the necessary paperwork to allow you to claim EI for the period of your leave.

If you live in Quebec, the provincial government subsidizes parental leave quite generously. If the combined value of provincial and federal government payments is equivalent to your salary during the first month of parental leave, we will not pay a top-up.
