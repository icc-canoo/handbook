# Why we exist
What's the point of the ICC? Why are we necessary?

Good questions! Let's dive in.

## Our purpose
Many public benefit organizations have long-winded and ambiguous purpose statements that make it difficult to know what they're actually about. Maybe they think this affords them flexibility to appeal to a wider range of supporters, but the reality is that ambiguity demotivates staff and turns off donors. We don't want to do that.

Our purpose statement is designed to be short, clear, and inspiring. It commits us to a straightforward and principled course:

> The ICC works to unlock Canada for newcomers, facilitating and encouraging the journey towards full and active Canadian citizenship.

We often use the following diagram to explain what we mean:

Some important details to remember:

1. The "citizenship" part of our name refers to newcomers obtaining citizenship.

2. Citizenship is a legal status but also a state of mind. We care about the legal status but we care more about the feeling of belonging, the sense that "this is my place" and "these are my people".

__TLDR; *We do everything we can so that newcomers fall in love with Canada, become citizens, and build their futures here.*__

## Why Canada needs us
Canada is in desperate need of renewal. Immigration is our best option for achieving it. There are economic and non-economic reasons for greater immigration, which we'll get into.

But we must also remember that there has to be something in it for immigrants too. They will only stay and contribute to our shared success if they find a good life here. That means Canada's success depends on immigrants' success. When they love it here and do well, we all thrive. The ICC's programs help newcomers have positive experiences on the journey to citizenship -- especially at the beginning. As you'll see below, our success in delivering these experiences is a matter of essential national importance.

### A dying country
Our population is aging *really* fast.

By 2030, the entire Baby Boomer generation will have reached retirement age. It will cost *a lot* to care for them in old age, but the number of working-age people (i.e. taxpaying people) continues to decline. When public healthcare came to be, there were about 5 taxpaying workers for every benefit-collecting retiree. Today, we're closing in on 2-to-1.

If we want to sustain our prosperous society and the generous public services that come with it, we need more working people. As fertility rates continue to decline, immigration takes on a bigger and bigger share of Canada's population growth.

Here's the best part: immigrants are not just new people, they're the right people. They are far younger than the average Canadian...

...and far better educated too.

It's no wonder then that immigrants are behind some of Canada's strongest startups, like Shopify (founded by German-born Tobias Lütke) and ApplyBoard (founded by the Iranian-born Basiri brothers).

__*The moral of the story is quite compelling. If we bring the best, we can be the best.*__

### More than money
Newcomers' contributions to Canada's current and future success extend far beyond the economic realm.

Thanks to newcomers and their kids who quite literally wrap themselves in the Maple Leaf, Canada qualified for the 2022 World Cup, ending a 36-year drought.

One of Canada's biggest hit shows, which succeeded domestically and abroad, is _Kim's Convenience_, written by Korean immigrant, Ins Choi. It's a story that can only happen here, and audiences around the world lapped it up.

Tareq Hadhad has become an international sensation since arriving in Canada in 2016 as a refugee from Syria. He has built a hugely successful business, Peace by Chocolate, which is a major contributor to community organizations across the country (including the ICC). This virtuous enterprise has garnered tonnes of attention, showing the world why Canada's openness to newcomers is such a core strength of ours. Tareq's story has now been turned into a feature film, with Canada's welcoming disposition playing a central role. Tareq became a citizen at the first available opportunity and joined our Canoo program soon after.

### Crisis of confidence emerging
Overall, Canada remains a great place for immigrants to settle. But there are storm clouds emerging that we can't ignore.

For starters, the number of immigrants who become citizens within 10 years of arrival plummeted by almost 20% between 2001 and 2016.

<bordered-image alt="Chart of Canada's declining citizenship rates" src="./_media/declining-citizenship-rates.png"></bordered-image>

We found this pretty surprising, so in March 2022, we polled about 2,000 immigrants to ask about their experience of life in Canada. The result was even more surprising: 30% of newcomers under the age of 35 told us they were likely to leave Canada within two years, mostly for economic reasons.

## Bringing it all together

1. __Newcomers are essential to Canada's future__: economically, and in every other way. We all benefit when newcomers thrive.

2. __Newcomers are having a harder time realizing their quality of life expectations__, causing fewer to choose Canadian citizenship and leading (too) many to second-guess their decision to make Canada home. If this trend continues, Canada is in *serious* trouble.

3. __The ICC is the only national organization addressing this situation of vital national importance at full scale__.
    * Our enhanced citizenship ceremonies celebrate the once-in-a-lifetime milestone of becoming Canadian even more special and desirable.
    * Canoo can help every single newcomer have a positive early experience of Canada, helping them to get through a difficult transition by having fun and making connections. Over 500,000 people have already benefitted from Canoo.
    * Our research keeps an eye on the journey from arrival to citizenship, identifying areas where people get knocked off the track and advising our programming teams about how we can do a better job of keeping people on it.

__TLDR; The ICC is an essential national service. When we succeed, Canada succeeds. If we fail, Canada is in trouble.__
