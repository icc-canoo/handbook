# Your first two weeks

Starting a new job is often an intense an experience. You're really excited but maybe a bit nervous too. You want to contribute, but can easily become overwhelmed as new people, programs, practices, information, and expectations fly at you.

Our leadership team has done a lot of thinking about the experience of starting at the ICC and how getting started on the right foot is essential to building a long and fruitful career at the ICC. We've designed a fairly structured onboarding process to give you everything you need at this critical time, and we wrote it down here so you know exactly what to expect, and to alleviate any worry you may have before you begin.

Over your first two weeks, you’ll be on two learning streams. You'll learn about the ICC, our processes, culture and organization wide priorities. We like to call this "setting the stage". But you'll also learn about the specifics of what you’ll need to succeed in your new role, including your team's processes and objectives and learning how to use the tools you'll depend on every day.   

Here's what your first two weeks will look like:

## Before you start
Tanya, our Finance and Operations Manager, will send you your laptop and logins and all that fun stuff before you start, so you're ready to go from Day 1. Your calendar should be pre-populated with a few key dates and milestones pertaining to your onboarding. You'll also receive info about your onboarding buddy (yes, we do that), and we hope you'll share a bit about yourself with your buddy in advance too -- especially things that don't show up on your CV.

## Week 1

### Your first day
Your first day will be a Monday. We want you to stay home that day and not work. Don't worry: you'll get paid and this doesn't count towards your paid holiday allowance. Spend the time reading this handbook, doing laundry, going for a walk, seeing friends, or anything else you need to do to clear your head and get ready for this next phase in your career.

### Your second day
You'll start the day by meeting your buddy quickly before moving on to a 1:1 with your manager, who will brief you on your team's OKRs and give you a personal project that you'll complete by the end of your second week and present to the greater team. You’ll also receive information about your expected performance metrics covering your first three months. These standards should be very clear and attainable.

A quick aside about these onboarding projects so you don't get the wrong idea. Of course we understand that people who just started a new job have a lot to learn before they're up to full speed. We set our expectations accordingly and build an assignment we know you can ace. You won't have to pull 16 hour days to complete this project, and you'll get lots of support and encouragement along the way from both your buddy and your manager. Ultimately, this is an  authentic way to learn the ropes while actually doing the job you came to do. And the finale is always lots of fun.

After meeting your manager, you'll meet your new team and then get to work.

### Rest of week 1
You'll get a good amount of meeting-free work time to advance your project, with frequent check-ins by your manager and your buddy to make sure you have all the support you need to succeed. Our CEO and the rest of the senior leadership team will drop in to say hi. You'll need to book time to meet Tanya, Finance and Operations Manager, and also do a short HR training session. 

You'll also need to watch a few training videos about Salesforce, our CRM, even if you've used it before. We do lots of cross-departmental work, so keeping accurate records is *__really__* important.

Finally, you'll end the week with your first OKR check-in. 

## Week 2

We'll try to give you space to advance your project and your buddy and manager will still check-in regularly to make sure you have what you need to succeed. You'll spend much of your time shadowing your colleagues and meeting a few new ones to make sure you have a clear, holistic view of how your work contributes to the ICC's overall success. 

You'll get an info dump from our Ideas & Insights team containing a whole whack of information, publications, videos, and other materials to help you become an expert in Canada's immigration system, the contemporary immigrant experience, and the impacts of our programs on newcomers and on the country. You don't need to review the whole trove right away, but you will need to submit a reflection on this in your third week, so schedule some time to get through the material over the coming days.
