# Your first two weeks

Starting a new job is often an intense an experience. You're really excited but a bit nervous. You want to contribute but can easily become overwhelemed as new people, practices, information, and expectations flow your way.

We hope you'll have a long and fruitful career at the ICC, and we want to start you off on the right foot from Day 1 -- or even before that.

Here's what you can expect on your first two weeks:

## Before you start
Tanya, our supernatural Office Manager, will send you your laptop and logins and all that fun stuff before you start, so you're ready to go from Day 1. You'll also receive info about your onboarding buddy (yes, we do that), and we hope you'll share a bit about yourself with your buddy in advance too -- especially things that don't show up on your CV.

## Week 1

### Your first day
In all likelihood, your first day will be a Monday. We want you to stay home that day and do no work. Don't worry: you'll get paid and this doesn't count towards your paid holiday allowance. Spend the time reading this handbook, doing laundry, going for a walk, or anything else you need to do to clear your head and get ready for this next phase in your career.

### Your second day
We have a policy of holding no meetings on Tuesdays (we gave it the highly original name of No Meeting Tuesdays), but your first Tuesday is an exception to that rule. We want your team to be available to meet you and we know they'll have no meetings that day, so it's the perfect time!

You'll start the day by meeting your buddy quickly before moving on to a 1:1 with your manager, who will brief you on your team's OKRs and give you a personal project that you'll be expected to complete by the end of your second week. This point of this project is not to get you slaving away from the get-go and you won't have to pull 14 hour days to complete it. We brought you here for a reason and we want you to get straight into the team as a full contributor. You'll get lots of support and encouragement along the way.

After that, you'll meet your new team and then get to work on your project.

### Rest of week 1
You'll get a good amount of meeting-free work time to advance your project, with frequent check-ins by your manager and your buddy to make sure you have all the support you need to succeed. Our CEO and the rest of the senior leadership team will drop in to say hi. You'll need to book time to meet Tanya, our Office Manager, and also do a short training session with Jill, who handles HR. The government makes this training mandatory and we try to do it in the most straightforward, efficient, and human way possible.

You'll also need to watch a few training videos about Salesforce, our CRM, even if you've used it before. We do lots of cross-departmental work, so keeping accurate records is *__really__* important.

Finally, you'll end the week with your first OKR checkin and our Friday afternoon all-staff hangout, lovingly called the Meeting of the Minds.

## Week 2

### Monday
We'll try to give you space to advance your project, since you'll be presenting it to the team at the end of this week. Your buddy and manager will still check-in regularly to make sure you have what you need to succeed.

### Tuesday
You'll get an info dump from our Ideas & Insights team containing a whole whack of information, publications, videos, and other materials to help you become an expert in Canada's immigration system, the contemporary immigrant experience, and the impacts of our programs on newcomers and on the country. You don't need to review it all right away, but you will need to submit a reflection on this the following week, so schedule some time to get through the material over the coming days.

### Wednesday
The first draft of your project presentation is due at lunchtime. If you live near your manager and are nice to them, they may even buy you that lunch!

### Thursday
You'll have the chance to make any adjustments your manager recommends, and the chance to practice your presentation with your buddy.

### Friday
Your manager will sign off on your presentation by lunchtime. You can chat with your buddy or do whatever you want for the next couple hours. You'll do another OKR checkin around 3pm, and then head to the Meeting of the Minds to show the rest of us what you've been working on!
