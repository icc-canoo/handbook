*NOTE*: It's important to acknowledge that some people find these meet-ups tiring. Not everyone is an extrovert, and there's a lot of together time and a lot of programming at these things. We encourage everyone to paritipate in the full program, but if you need some time away for quiet work or just to take a break, that's fine. Just let your manager know.
