# Internal systems

## 1Password
The home of __*ALL*__ (yes, all) of your logins and passwords. The security of our systems is paramount. Shared logins and other bush league practices put our organization and its beneficiaries at risk. Don't be that person. Use 1Password 100% of the time.

## Asana
Project management software for moving large projects to completion in an orderly way.

## Microsoft Viva Goals (formerly Ally.io)
This is where your OKRs are tracked and updated. The easiest way to use this is via the MS Teams integration, but you can also login with your browser. You can also set up more complicated integrations with Salesforce, a database, or even a spreadsheet so your OKRs update automatically.

## Salesforce + Campaign Monitor
This is our main CRM and process hub for a variety of core programming tasks. Salesforce integrates seamlessly with Campaign Monitor, which is what we use to send mass email and run drip campaigns. Make sure to install the Outlook integration for Salesforce so you can log incoming communications properly.
