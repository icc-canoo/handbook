# Why we exist
What's the point of the ICC? Why are we necessary?

Good questions! Let's dive in.

## Our purpose
Many public benefit organizations have really long-winded and ambiguous purpose statements that makes it difficult to know what they're all about. Maybe they think this approach affords them flexibility to appeal to a wider range of supporters, but the reality is that ambiguity demotivates staff and turns off donors. We don't want to do that!

Our purpose statement is designed to be short, clear, and inspiring. It commits us to a clear, principled course:

> The ICC works to unlock Canada for newcomers, facilitating and encouraging the journey towards full and active Canadian citizenship.

You could draw it out like this:

Some important details to remember:

1. The "citizenship" part of our name refers to newcomers obtaining citizenship.

2. Citizenship is a legal status but also a state of mind. We care about the legal status but we care more about the feeling of belonging.

__TLDR; *We do everything we can so that newcomers fall in love with Canada, become citizens, and build their futures here.*__

## Why Canada needs us
Canada is in desperate need of renewal. Immigration is our best option for achieving it. There are economic and non-economic reasons for greater immigration, which we'll get into shortly.

But we must also remember that there has to be something in it for the immigrants too. They will only stay and contribute to our shared success if they find a good life here. That means Canada's success depends on immigrants' success. When they love it here, we all thrive. The ICC's programs help newcomers to have positive experiences on the journey to citizenship. As you'll see below, our success in delivering these experiences is a matter of essential national importance.

### A dying country
Our population is aging *really* fast.

By 2030, the entire Baby Boomer generation will have reached retirement age. It will cost *a lot* to care for them in their old age, but the number of working-age people continues to decline. When public healthcare came to be, there were nearly 5 taxpaying workers for every benefit-collecting retiree. Today, we're closing in on 2-to-1.

If we want to sustain our prosperous society and the generous public services that come with it, we need more working people. The average women is having fewer babies, meaning that immigration is now responsible for the lion's share of Canada's population growth.

Immigrants are not just new people, they're the right people. They are far younger than the average Canadian...

...and far better educated too.

It's no wonder then that immigrants are behind some of Canada's strongest startups, like Shopify (founded by German-born Tobias Lütke) and ApplyBoard (founded by the Iranian-born Basiri brothers).

__*The moral of the story is quite compelling: if we bring the best, we can be the best.*__

### More than money
Newcomers' contributions to Canada's future success extend far beyond the economic realm.

Thanks to newcomers and their kids who quite literally wrapped themselves in the Maple Leaf, Canada qualified for the 2022 World Cup, ending a 36-year drought.

One of Canada's biggest hit shows, which succeeded domestically and abroad, is _Kim's Convenience_, written by Korean immigrant, Ins Choi. It's a story that can only happen here, and and audiences around the world lapped it up.

Tareq Hadhad has become an international sensation since arriving in Canada in 2016 as a refugee from Syria. His hugely successful business, Peace by Chocolate, has shown the world why Canada's openness to newcomers is such a good idea. His story has now been turned into a feature film, with Canada's welcoming disposition playing a central role. Tareq became a citizen at the first available opportunity. He then became a Canoo member and now contributes actively to the ICC.

### Crisis of confidence emerging
Overall, Canada remains a great place for immigrants to settle. But there are storm clouds emerging that we can't ignore.

For starter's the number of immigrants who become citizens within 10 years of arrival in Canada plummeted by almost 20% between 2001 and 2016.

We found this pretty surprising, so in March 2022, we polled about 2,000 immigrants to ask about their experience of life in Canada. The result was pretty surprising: 30% of newcomers under the age of 35 said they were likely to leave Canada within two years, mostly for economic reasons.

## Bringing it all together

1. __Newcomers are essential to Canada's future__, both economically and in every other way. We all benefit when newcomers thrive.

2. __Newcomers are having a harder time realizing their quality of life expectations__, causing fewer to choose Canadian citizenship and leading (too) many to second-guess their decision to make Canada home. If this trend continues, Canada is in *serious* trouble.

3. __The ICC is the only national organization addressing this situation at full scale__.
    * Our ceremonies celebrate citizenship to make it special and more desirable.
    * Canoo can help every single newcomer have a positive early experience of Canada, helping them to get through a difficult transition by having fun and making connections.
    * Our research keeps an eye on the journey from arrival to citizenship, identifying areas where people get knocked off the track and advising our programming teams about how we can do a better job of keeping people on it.

__TLDR; The ICC is an essential national service. When we succeed, Canada succeeds. If we fail, Canada is in trouble.__
