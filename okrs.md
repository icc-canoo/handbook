# OKRs
Part of our cultural aspirations are to always be deliberate. Reacting to whatever comes at you is exhausting and mostly futile. *We* should decide what we want to do. We use a system called Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for making those decisions and tracking our progress towards them.

The OKR system is well-established for companies and charities of all sizes. Google adopted the OKR system when they had just 8 employees and they still use it today. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation uses the system too.

Each department sets their OKRs every quarter. We also set quarterly OKRs for the full organization. The process of picking OKRs can be a bit intense but it's well-worth it. These decisions will govern your work for the next three months. If you're going to devote so much energy to something, shouldn't you take the time to think and through and pick your course deliberately?

## The OKR magic
OKRs help us do four things:

1. __Focus and commit​__ to specific directions while saying no to others.

2. __Align and connect__ across and within teams.

3. __Create radical, top-to-bottom transparency​__ so everyone can see what everyone else -- up to and including the CEO -- is working on and how it's going.

4. __Stretch for amazing!​__ OKRs are meant to challenge us and take us further than we've been before.

You can learn more about OKRs [here](https://www.whatmatters.com/get-started). When you start, you'll also get a copy of [*Measure what matters* ](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/measure-what-matters-how-google/9780525536222-item.html), so you can familiarize yourself with this powerful system.

## OKRs are not

1. __Linked to pay.__ Sometimes you can fail to achieve your objectives and still succeed in your job. We keep these things separate.

2. __About micromanagement__. Actually, a key purpose of OKRs is to set a clear goals so you can exercise apply your talents with autonomy, to meet the goals in the way you think is best. We encourage teams and individuals to pick their own OKRs wherever possible.

3. __Set in stone__. Things happen. It's OK to adjust our OKRs mid-cycle when circumstances fundamentally change, or when something is clearly not going to work and doesn't warrant more energy. As always, we just ask that changes be made deliberately, informed by full and reasoned debate.

4. __Always easy at first__. The OKR system can take some time to get used to. Don't worry. That's normal. Stick with it.
